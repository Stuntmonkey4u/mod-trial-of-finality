### Player Testing Guide: The Trial of Finality

**Welcome, Testers!**

You are about to face the **Trial of Finality**, a high-stakes arena challenge that will test your skill, teamwork, and courage. The rewards are great, but be warned: the risk is even greater.

**What is the Trial of Finality?**

This is a 5-wave PvE challenge where you and your group will face increasingly difficult enemies. If you succeed, you will be handsomely rewarded with gold and a unique title. However, if you fall in combat and are not resurrected by a teammate **before the end of the wave**, your character's journey will end. **Permanently.**

**How to Participate**

1.  **Form a Group:** You must be in a group of 1 to 5 players. The level difference between the highest and lowest level member cannot be too large.
2.  **Find Fateweaver Arithos:** This mysterious figure is your gateway to the trial. Speak with him to learn more.
3.  **Start the Trial:** Only the group leader can initiate the trial. When your leader starts the process, you will be asked to confirm your participation. Type `/trialconfirm yes` to accept your fate.
4.  **Enter the Arena:** Once everyone confirms, your group will be teleported into the trial arena. You will find a **"Trial Token"** in your inventoryâ€”this signifies your participation.

**The Rules of Engagement**

*   **Survive 5 Waves:** Your goal is to defeat all five waves of enemies.
*   **Stay in the Arena:** Leaving the designated arena boundaries is considered fleeing. You will receive one warning. If you do not return immediately, you will forfeit the trial for your entire group.
*   **Death is (Almost) Permanent:** If you die, you are considered "downed." If your group defeats the wave while you are still dead, your fate is sealed, and your character will be permanently lost.
*   **Resurrection is Your Only Hope:** A teammate's resurrection spell is the ONLY thing that can save you from a permanent end. If you are resurrected before the wave concludes, you are back in the fight!

**The Forfeit Option**

If the challenge proves too great and your group wishes to withdraw, you can initiate a vote to forfeit.

*   Type `/trialforfeit` to start a vote.
*   All other active members must also type `/trialforfeit` within 30 seconds to agree.
*   If the vote passes, the trial will end safely. No one will suffer perma-death, but you will not receive any rewards.

**Your Mission as a Tester**

*   Play through the trial multiple times. Try to win, and don't be afraid to fail.
*   Report any bugs you encounter: Do waves spawn correctly? Do rewards work?
*   Provide feedback on the difficulty. Is it too hard? Too easy?
*   Test the forfeit system.
*   Most importantly, confirm that the perma-death and resurrection mechanics are working as described.

Thank you for your courage. May you emerge as a Conqueror!
